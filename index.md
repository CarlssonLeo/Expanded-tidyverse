# The Expanded Tidyverse

This is a non-comprahensive list of R packages belonging to what I'd like to call the expanded tidyverse. These packages adhere to a tidyverse philosophy, with pipeable and clean data, often building on the core tidyverse. Don't know what that is? Check out [The tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

## Other tidy packages
- [Tidytext](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/), a collection of functions related to text mining
- [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), modelling using tidy principles
- [Tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/), expanding the tidyverse to graph structured data
- [TidyJSON](https://github.com/colearendt/tidyjson), for interacting with JSON-data

Know another package that should be here? [Hit me up](https://github.com/CarlssonLeo/Expanded-tidyverse)!
